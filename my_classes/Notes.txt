Do we want su to be inserted by sub-contractors?Model would imply that sp_n could becoe sp1 in some cases and sp1 could then be sp_n. Not sure that i like that idea

su rota? cover times and numbers

Map sites to sps

Map staff to sites

proximity matrix

centrally mananged staffing. sp1 can see all staff in proximity and assign to subs accordingly

add capability to import staff and sites via spreadsheet import

TADA reinsert postcodes to valid_postcodes from rota_generator

Add a table for su_id and sp_id tht shows all the sp_ids that can provide service to a su_id
